ü§Ø What if mathematical laws are "compressed knowledge" from previous universe iterations?

My new research project explores the "Pretrained Universe Hypothesis" - the idea that our cosmos might be the output of a vast computational learning system.

Math = Universal memory? üåå

üî¨ Exploring Mathematics Through Code

I've just open-sourced a comprehensive mathematical research toolkit built in Dart. The project demonstrates how modern programming languages can be powerful tools for mathematical exploration.

Key features:
‚Ä¢ Number theory algorithms (primes, factorization, modular arithmetic)
‚Ä¢ Complex number operations for fractal mathematics
‚Ä¢ Statistical analysis tools
‚Ä¢ ASCII visualizations of mathematical concepts
‚Ä¢ Performance-optimized BigInt calculations

But here's what makes it unique: the project led me to explore a fascinating hypothesis about the nature of reality itself - what if mathematical laws represent "compressed knowledge" from previous cosmic iterations?

The intersection of computation, mathematics, and philosophy continues to yield surprising insights.

Title: Built a mathematical research toolkit in Dart - featuring ASCII Mandelbrot sets and philosophical cosmology

I created a comprehensive mathematical library in Dart that goes beyond typical programming exercises. It includes number theory, complex analysis, statistical tools, and even ASCII visualizations of fractals.

What started as exploring Dart's mathematical capabilities led to some mind-bending questions about the nature of reality. I've included a philosophical exploration of what I call the "Pretrained Universe Hypothesis" - the idea that mathematical laws might be compressed knowledge from previous cosmic iterations.

Title: Mathematical Research Project: From Prime Numbers to Cosmic Philosophy

Created an open-source mathematical research toolkit that explores number theory, complex analysis, and statistical methods. But it led to something unexpected - a philosophical exploration of whether mathematical laws might be "learned parameters" from cosmic evolution.

The project includes working implementations of:
- Prime number research and gap analysis
- Complex number operations and fractal generation
- Statistical analysis and visualization tools
- ASCII plotting utilities

Plus a deep dive into the question: "What if the universe is pretrained?"
